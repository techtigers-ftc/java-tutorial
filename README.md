# Java Tutorial

> This repository contains a bootcamp Java tutorial designed to help beginner
> FTC students and mentors quickly get up to speed with Java programming.

## Introduction

This repository is deliberately designed to be simple and easy to follow and 
execute. It allows the students to focus on the core concepts of Java without
requiring access to an FTC robot or the FTC SDK.

Ideally, students will be able to run the code on their own computers, led 
by an instructor or mentor with access to an accompanying presentation.

Code for each lesson is defined in a separate branch that is not intended to 
be merged into the main branch. The branches are named according to the
lesson, beginning with the lesson number `01`, `02`, etc.
